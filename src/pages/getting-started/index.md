Why is getting started so damn hard?

Setting up this blog has been on my backlog for way too long. I've been procrastinating on this task
for longer than I'd like to admit, and I've gotten extremely good at finding excuses for not to do it.

But today is the day. I'm determined to not let the day end before publishing these words out to the interwebs.

Unfortunately, it's almost 11pm and I'm running out of time, so I won't be able to write a big inspirational essay
on the meaning of life and the secret of happiness. Instead, I'll leave you with one of my favorite **Mark Twain** quotes;
which is not only way better than anything I could ever write, but also seemed particularly appropriate for the occasion.

> **The secret of getting ahead is getting started.**
> The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming
> tasks into small manageable tasks, and starting on the first one.
> #### Mark Twain
